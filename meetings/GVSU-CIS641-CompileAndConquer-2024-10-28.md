Discussion points: 

* Demonstrated our individual responsibilites from last week of creating an initial "Hello, World" React Native app and finalizing Figma design screens to follow for development
* Explored React Native Paper and decided to utilize the theming properties the framework provides
* Defined our goals for this week and assigned responsibilities for creating the splash, login, and registration screens, setting up the firebase authentication workflow, and setting up detox

Goals for next week (include responsibilities):

* Create a splash, login, and registration screen following the Figma designs (Natalie)
* Apply a theme to the whole app using React Native Paper's theming (Natalie)
* Create a firebase account for the project and share the credentials (Marcos)
* Implement authentication between the screens and firebase (Marcos)
