Discussion points:

* Met with Dr. Engelsma, who we thought might have insights on our roadblock since he teaches the mobile app course, but he, too, could not figure out a solution 
* Revised our timeline to accommodate this delay and timeboxed the issue for the remainder of the day to avoid falling further behind
* Planned our next steps, focusing on creating the base designs for the account settings and dashboard screens

* Implement tab navigation to enable screen switching (Natalie)
