# Introduction

Our project plans to address the challenge faced by individuals, particularly students, who are actively seeking career opportunities. They often struggle to keep track of companies they are interested in, job applications they have submitted, and their overall progress throughout the job search. This project will involve creating an application to centralize and organize this information in a user-friendly format. 

By providing a single platform for tracking job applications, our app will reduce the stress and confusion often associated with managing multiple applications. The app will be cross-functional, meaning it will be available for both iOS and Android users. Additionally, users will be able to register for an account so that their data is persisted and secure. The app's most prominent feature will be allowing users to input and tack a variety of information, including job application and company details. 

Users will then be able to make data-driven decisions using their analytics dashboard, enhaching their job search strategy. Finally, we plan to incorporate notifications for company events, applications deadlines, and follow-up reminders. Overall, our project will lead to a more modernized and efficient job search experience, ultimately improving the likelihood of the user's chances of securing job offers.

# Anticipated Technologies

We anticipate using quite a few different technologies for our project.

* **Git** for version control
* **Figma** for designing mockups
* **React Native** for development
* **Firebase** for user authentication
* **Detox** for testing

# Method/Approach

Our estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project closely relates to our estimated timeline below and can be broken down into four main phases.

1. We will begin by identifying the specific needs of our intended users, drawing from our personal experiences as both of us are currently in the job search phase. This phase will primarily involve requirements gathering and finalizing our list of essential features.

2. Using Figma, we plan to integrate iOS and Android-specific libraries to create mockups that outline the application's design and user interactions. This phase will include selecting a cohesive theme, designing specific screens, and gaining a high-level understanding of how the components will interact with one another.

3. Once our mockups are finalized, we will enter the development phase, which will be the bulk of the project. This will involve utilizing a basic React Native template to establish a pre-built project structure with essential features like navigation routing. We will then create individual components based on our Figma designs. Additionally, we will set up a Firebase account to manage user authentication, data storage, and secure account management. One of the final features we will implement will be notifications, as they are the most challenging to test in a simulation environment.

4. After development is complete, we will conduct thorough testing using Detox to ensure functionality across both iOS and Android devices. Finally, we aim to deploy the app for testing, and if time permits, launch it officially on the respective app stores.

# Estimated Timeline

* Define Requirements (1 Week)
* Design Mockups (2 Weeks)
* Develop Application (4 Weeks)
* Deployment & Testing (1 Week)

# Anticipated Problems

There are three main challenges for this project that we can identify even before uncovering unknowns during development. First and foremost, as a team we will need to have an equal understanding and proficiency of our chosen technologies. Additionally, we think scalability could be another concern, as managing a large amount of data effectively is crucial to prevent the application from slowing down. Lastly, we anticpate setting up notifications will pose a unique challenge as they cannot be fully tested in a simulation environment.
