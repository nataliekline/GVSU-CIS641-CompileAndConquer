AppXpert is a cross-functional mobile app designed to simplify the job search experience, especially for students, by centralizing everything in one place. Users begin by registering for an account to ensure their data is persisted and secure. The app's main functionality allows users to input and monitor details, including job application materials and company information. They can then utilize their dashboard to view overall progress and success or rejection rates. Additionally, users can access a calendar for important dates like application deadlines, interviews, and follow-up reminders. By serving as a comprehensive hub for all application-related information, AppXpert aims to reduce the stress and confusion often associated with managing multiple applications.
